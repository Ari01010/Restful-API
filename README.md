# Restful-API
A simple REST API for managing users. It demonstrates the core principles of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

This Python code is a REST API built with the Flask framework. It acts as a simple server that allows you to manage a list of users.A RESTful API uses standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources, in this case, user data.

This API uses a simple in-memory Python dictionary to store user data, which means all data will be lost if the server is restarted.
